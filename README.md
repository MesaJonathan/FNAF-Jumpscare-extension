# FNAF-Jumpscare-extension
Chrome extension that plays an extremely loud fnaf jumpscare at random intervals to keep you alert while working

## How would I do this
1. First I need to collect the actual jumpscare videos (Audio and Video).
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjI9LU70sxY this video has them all with a green background
    - Need to put black background on video -> chop it up into individual videos
